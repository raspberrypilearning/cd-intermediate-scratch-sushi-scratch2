## Introduction

You’ve already learned the basics of Scratch (and if you haven’t, check out the Beginner Scratch Sushi Cards) to make your first Scratch game. Here you’re going to learn a few more cool tricks and make one of my favourite Scratch projects: it draws colourful patterns and, if you set it up right, can be really cool to watch.
